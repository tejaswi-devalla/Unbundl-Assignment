In this approach, I opted for a simple solution without using any external frameworks, relying on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML Structure:

The HTML structure is straightforward, comprising a container for the carousel, individual product items, and navigation buttons.

## CSS (styles.css):

The CSS styles focus on simplicity and responsiveness.
The flex display property is utilized for the product carousel, allowing easy horizontal alignment of product items.

## JavaScript (script.js):

The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the logic of the carousel, including manual navigation and automatic rotation.
Functions like showSlide, prevSlide, and nextSlide control the display of slides and navigation.
The setInterval function is employed for automatic rotation, providing a smooth user experience.
